Raw, unstructured data dosen‚Äôt have much utility and as a result offers little value, however, data that‚Äôs structured and accessible can become an asset that solves problems, creates opportunity and provides real-world value.\nAs modern web applications become more and more data driven, they are increasingly consuming data from multiple sources. Headless seeks to help people without software engineering and data science training to become one of those sources and realize new, passive revenue streams that can add high margin revenue to the balance sheet faster and easier then ever before.\nObjectives The Headless API, powered by Directus, as an easy to use data structuring application for accessing, managing and visualizing all kinds of data. In addition to structuring that raw data, we seek to deliver a secure and scaleable framework for sharing and presenting it in a simple, orderly, and intuitive way that becomes useable for your own business and for other people and businesses willing to pay for it. Most importantly we‚Äôre leveraging core Directus technology that allows the owner of the data, you, to maintain total control and authority over it.\nBy structuring and making data available for consumption by third parties, it‚Äôs transformed into an asset that can be monitized in other words, your data becomes a product. With that outcome in mind, Headless is bing developed with ways and means to monetize your newly structured data by making it available to paying clients and processing payments based on usage, all done autonomously and with the intent of creating new, virtually passive income streams for small business owernes.\nüëâ Visit the project homepage: headless.ml\nüëâ Visit the project api: api.headless.ml\nüëâ Visit the Github repo:\n","date":1630159140,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630159140,"objectID":"58b742c52880f47000cbac0f173aabaf","permalink":"https://berno.ml/project/headless.ml/","publishdate":"2021-08-28T13:59:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/headless.ml/","section":"project","summary":"A curated suit of opensource data management tools \u0026 functions.","tags":["Deep Learning","Headless","GraphQL","Directus","Data"],"title":"headless.ml","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Click To Watch On Cinnamon\nIntroduction To Blockchain Based Crypto Domain Names Some argue that despite all of it‚Äôs positive benefits, the internet has evolved into an exclusive, corporate-controlled ecosystem where to much power, money and control is centralized with giants like Facebook, Google and Amazon. Distributed computing technology like blockchains have been identified as a solution to this centralization and a way to reclaim our digital identities and digital assests. Whether or not you agree that argument or share those concerns, forward thinking entrepreneurs should be aware of a new breed of ‚ÄúWeb 3.0‚Äù blockchain startups working to help distribute ownership and control of digital assets. Regardless of what‚Äôs feuling blockchains growth, it‚Äôs evolving fast and creating exciting new opportunities for those willing to engage. In this executive summary we‚Äôll look at one area of blockchain growth, Crytpo Domains. Blockchain Registrar companies building tools that help developers get decentralized crypto domains and decentralized applications (DAPPs) onto the internet without any involvement from authorities like ICANN or Verisign that currently have control over registering .com, .net, .org, etc. domains. In addition to decentralizing domain name services (DNS) the hosting industry is being reimagined without the need for traditional web hosting providers like Godaddy, Hostgator, AWS and the like and by moving DNS and web hosting away from centralized servers and to decentralized peer to peer, blockchain networks, fundamentally changing how information is created, stored and transmitted on the web.\nThe challenge isn‚Äôt in the building of decentralized software or platforms, no, DAPP developers and blockchain startups have already proven it‚Äôs possible and new tools come online regularily that make it easier to deploy decentralized applications. But as I‚Äôve learned the way on past projects, just because you built it, doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they‚Äôre going to come. No, the real challenge lies in creating meaningful options, experiences, and tools that solve realworld problems for users or create exciting new experiences for fans and followers that are financially sustainable, usable and compelling enough to drive enterprise and ultimately mass adoption. So, it doesn‚Äôt matter if a more privacy-preserving, user-controlled version of Facebook or twitter is created or not as people rarely adopt new technology for ideological reasons like decentralization or privacy alone. Rather, history shows us that technology adoption is based on utility, convenience, price, usability, the problems it solves and probably most importantly, whether or not their friends and family are using it. Another thing to consider in the adoption of new technology is any kind of competitive advantage that new technology creates for users whether that‚Äôs individuals or businesses. So let‚Äôs apply this all to the interesting new world of blockchain based crypto-domains.\nWhen most people think of blockchain, they think of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ethereum. In this executive summary, we‚Äôre going to look at a different usecase for blockchain technology outside of cryptocurrency, specifically, the emerging world of Blockchain or Crypto Domains. As mentioned in the intro, many believe that the webhosting and domain registration industry is primed for massive disruption and that new decentralized apps (DAPPs) are primed and ready to provide alternatives, or even outright replace the current domain name service (DNS) and webhosting providers. The real question isn‚Äôt if it‚Äôs possible, but if there‚Äôs a viable market for decentralized DNS and web hosting applications? Most people I know don‚Äôt understand the basic DNS functions available to them for managing their domain let alone understand the value that crypto domains create. Many DAPP CEOs think the time is right however, they have convinced investors, assembled teams of smart people and are building the alternative routes that will become the decentralized web.\nDNS Solved A Massive Problem \u0026amp; Fostered Adoption of The Internet. But ‚Ä¶ Domain Name Services (DNS) are an integral part of the web and arguably the technology that made mass adoption of the internet as we know it today even possible. A commonly used analogy is that DNS is the equivalent of the phonebook for the internet or similar to the caller ID feature that announces who‚Äôs calling by name instead of just displaying a telephone number. A domain name creates a human-readable address for a website that helps people to quickly identify and recall web addresses that otherwise would have been a string of random numbers in the form of an IP address. For example, my personal website chrisberno.net translates to an ip addresses of 151.101.1.195. Both the domain name and it‚Äôs corresponding IP address work just fine with or without the other, but it‚Äôs a lot easier to give someone my domain ‚Ä¶","date":1597778894,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597778954,"objectID":"fab064b74e26ce85be1c1f21d725599d","permalink":"https://berno.ml/post/internet-of-value-blockchain-domains-pt1/","publishdate":"2020-08-18T19:28:14Z","relpermalink":"/post/internet-of-value-blockchain-domains-pt1/","section":"post","summary":"The fourth industrial revolution will usher in the Internet of Value and create massive opportunity along the way.","tags":[],"title":"Blockchain Domain Names (Pt. ‚òùÔ∏è)","type":"post"},{"authors":["Chris Berno"],"categories":[],"content":"üì∫ Prefer to watch the presentation of this talk? Click To Watch On Cinnamon\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution \u0026amp; The New Token Economies Welcome to the Internet of Value (I.O.V.) ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm your host Chris Berno and in this Executive Summary we‚Äôre looking at Tokens, Tokenization and Token Economies, why you should have a working knowledge of them and ways they‚Äôre already being deployed today as well as future implications of them for your business and your own personal wealth.\nIntroduction For centuries we (humans) have been tokenizing objects as a means of exchanging value. From cowry shells and wampums in the ancient trade networks of Africa and Asia to the Chuck E. Cheese tokens you may have coveted as a kid or the rewards points you may have redeemed for an upgrade on a recent business trip. Generally, tokens have no or very little intrinsic value in and of themselves but represent the holder‚Äôs ability to exchange his or her tokens for something of massive value to the holder - well perceived massive value at least - extended play at the arcade or some extra legroom and free drinks on your last flight. Some examples of value could be cash money / fiat currency, access to products or services, or certain privileges (i.e. upgrade fo first-class or VIP early access to a Hollywood blockbuster) that otherwise would not be available.\nWhat Is A Token And Tokenization A token is an object or symbol that can be exchanged for something material or for services or privileges between two or more parties. Generally, tokens are created by issuers or businesses to improve customer experience, reduce workflow friction and/or increase customer loyalty. Outside of the two parties, the tokens are usually worthless. One example from the 20th century that (depending on your age) you may be able to relate to is the Chuck E. Cheese play tokens which first surfaced in the 1980s allowed players to convert fiat money into these tokens that could be used to play arcade games and purchase toys from the gift shop. Chuck E. Cheese has since retired to a token system and replaced it with a stored value player card but the token model was and remains a great example of token economics.\nFast forward into the 21st century and tokens are evolving with times and available technology. In the book, The Real Business of Blockchain, authors David Furlonger and Christophe Uzureau suggest that there are 4 categories of Tokens ‚Ä¶\nFour Token Types 1- Fiat Tokens - represent government-issued currencies such as the UD Dollar or the Euro and are traded in physical form aka money as we know it today - so, in this case good old fashion cash money is considered a token. Fiat currencies work well in the physical world as we use it to procure goods and services (i.e. 1 Big Mack Value Meal costs $8.95), but dosn‚Äôt work so well in digital or online transactions.\n2- Process Tokens - facilitate the use of fiat tokens in digital environments. Facebook authentication tokens for example are a very simple and basic example of how using process tokens can help you gain access to and facilitate transactions in digital environments. For example logging into your Netflix account using your Facebook or twitter credentials. This is a an example of a process token and you‚Äôre probably starting to get more comfortable using it.\n3- Complementary Tokens - enable exchange in closed environments. A good example here are the loyalty programs that have become so common in the travel industry (frequent flyer miles, hotel rewards, etc). These tokens maximize value for the issuer by encouraging specific behaviors in the token holders and/or customers.\n4- Cryptocurrencies - are digitally native currencies that can replace fiat and process tokens and can be used to create new kinds of assets. They are further divided into Utility, Security and Stability categories which we will examine in another section of the Internet of Value series. While cryptocurrencies haven‚Äôt transformed money in the real-world the way some cryptocurrency enthusiasts predicted they might, there are nonetheless some indications that some cryptocurrencies are gaining at least some awareness and recognition in the business world.\nToken Business Models Tokenization, the creation, and representation of value or assets is not a new idea. Fiat Tokens (aka money) have been used by governments and issued by central banks for thousands of years. In addition to Fiat tokens, we saw the emergence of complementary tokens with things like American Express Traveler‚Äôs checks, business loyalty programs (i.e. Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Program), and many other member-only type tokens that represented value to specific groups (i.e. American Express Customers or Chuck E. Cheese guests for example). More recently we‚Äôve seen the growth of Process tokens which help us control access to information and programs on our phones via applications and starting in 2009 with the introduction of bitcoin the very fist cryptocurrency tokens ‚Ä¶","date":1591301774,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591301774,"objectID":"5d649d9034198027399e142eaaae6f90","permalink":"https://berno.ml/post/internet-of-value-developing-token-economies-pt1/","publishdate":"2020-06-04T20:16:14Z","relpermalink":"/post/internet-of-value-developing-token-economies-pt1/","section":"post","summary":"The fourth industrial revolution will usher in the Internet of Value.

Bartering is the exchange of goods or services for other goods or services. For example, someone might swap a bag of rice for a bag of beans and call it an even exchange. But ‚Ä¶. there were limitations to this form of commerce ‚Ä¶ imagine for example all you had to barter with were chickens and no-one really needed chickens that day .. good luck getting that fresh produce or milk you need for your family. There were also physical limitations, for example, hauling around a bunch of chickens, or potatoes, or whatever assets you were barding with wasn‚Äôt really all that convenient ‚Ä¶ fast forward 2,000 years or so from our ancestor‚Äôs seemingly simple bartering of assets to today‚Äôs complex financial operations, money or currency was introduced and countries began minting their own series of coins with specific values that were tied to metals and since coins were given a designated value, it became easier to compare the cost of items people wanted and made it much easier to exchange value and conduct business. ‚ÄúMoney‚Äù, over time, became commonly accepted by people as an exchange for goods, services, or resources. Every country established it‚Äôs own exchange system and currencies and in doin so, solved a lot of the problems our ancestors faced exchanging value. The history of money as it evolved from precious-metal-based coins to paper currency to FIAT or government back promissory paper money that we know today is fascinating, but the focus of this executive brief is on the evolution of assets not necessarily money although you can see how the two are closely related ‚Ä¶\nToday, we live in a time when most assets are digitized in some way shape, or form and like it or not, we‚Äôre moving towards the digitization of anything we deem valuable. Most of us (humans) interact with digital assets thousands, if not tens of thousands of times every day. As a matter of fact, you‚Äôre interacting with countless digital assets right now by watching with this video from the research I put into developing this talk to the streaming media and browser applications that make it work on your device.\nFirst lets define an assets in general ‚Ä¶\nPhysical World Assets vs. Digital Assets Some ways the government¬†can improve citizens‚Äô online experience ‚Ä¶ Think of a physical world asset you possess ‚Ä¶ Now think about what makes it an asset? Can you resell it? Leave to your kids in your will? Does it add to your net worth? Or maybe it‚Äôs got emotional value and deemed priceless to you and your family. No matter what you picked ‚Ä¶ it probably revolves around value. To better organize and manage assets, classes and categories have evolved based on shared attributes like how the assets behave in the marketplace, the purchasing process, and how the government regulates them. Currently, financial professionals generally agree that there are four broad classes of assets: Equities (stocks), Fixed-income and debt (bonds), Money market and cash equivalents, Real estate and tangible assets \u0026lt;= don‚Äôt get hung up on the categories themselves - for the purpose of this summary what matters is that there is value in classification of our assets.\nSo what exactly is a digital asset and more importantly, why should you care?\nDigital First Governments - Links, Resources \u0026amp; References Well for starters a digital asset, like your great great great great great great great great great great grandmothers chicken is something that conveys or holds value for you in some way shape or form. Just like that chicken had value in a free market, this video had intrinsic value all be it the rules of the trade have changed a bit, but ultimately are similar in that they both were / are worth something to someone. Let‚Äôs say the chickens value was that it fed your family and the value in this video is knowledge which in the knowledge economy may very well feed my family and yours too! (think about it).\nA digital asset is anything that can be stored and transmitted electronically and that can be owned and thus, can have ownership and usage rights associated with it. Due to the diversity and variability of digital assets, ranging from ebooks and spreadsheets to billboard topping mp3s and Netflix originals.

By allowing citizens to access expanded information and benefits via the web during the pandemic that would normally require a visit to your local townhall or dmv. In doing so, it‚Äôs exposed a number of underlying issues, but it‚Äôs also highlighted corresponding opportunities along the way that some tech startups and technology service providers may want to pay attention to and work to provide products and services for. COVID-19 showed us that Governments¬†can adopt a startup mentality and that there are in fact new and different ways that government work can get done and provide servies to it‚Äôs citizens that are counting on them.\nGovernments are in the business of providing service and the demand for excellent service is online going to increase as more and more services migrate online. Whether filing taxes, securing benefits or one of the countless other services they provide, all of us use Government services at some point in our lives. But not all services were ready for the kind of rapid digital transition brought about by COVID-19 and a lot of public servants expressed concerns about moving certain services online for fear of failure and the bad press that goes along with it, but COVID-19 has forced the issue and will make it hard to go back to the way things were once the pandemic is over.¬†So now what? How will the pandemic change government service delivery models for the citizens they serve? What barriers still exist and what are the opportunities for startups and independent¬†tech contractors to help governments at ever level finish what COVID started?¬†Establishing Digital Identities \u0026amp; Getting data into machine-readable formats Some ways the government¬†can improve citizens‚Äô online experience ‚Ä¶ üí°¬†Streamline the onboarding process for citizens registering for benefits and services online. They already know my address, income, marital status, and hundreds of other dimensions, why not work harder to authentic citizens upfront and simply ask me to confirm things like address, date of birth, as opposed to making citizens re-type that data into clunky form scripts. Of course, privacy laws are in place for a reason but maybe sharing¬†certain pre-authorized data points within the governments secure network that could significantly improve a government‚Äôs ability to deliver mission-critical services is worth discussing.¬†üí° Implement Digital Identify Platforms that replace outdated user authentication¬†username¬†and password models that exist today. Digital Identity infrastructure would be a great first step in helping citizen fast-track access to benefits especially in times of crisis like COVID while increasing securing far beyond the firewall and authentication measures in use today.¬†Is there an openness of citizens to allow governments to build this kind of infrastructure? Are citizens willing to allowing sharing of certain data dimensions to make the processes of getting services easier? If so, what changes to policy and legislation would be required? Blockchain Tech startups that can help governments build transparent digital-first workflows (like a Digital Identity Platform) that build trust while improving security and ensuring privacy will be in great demand.¬†Innovation most likely won‚Äôt come from within ‚Ä¶ Governments seeking to use COVID-19 as a jump-off point for conducting more of its business online once the pandemic is over should consider looking at Startup business models for ways to iterate the introduction and adoption of new services and maybe even fund start-ups to do that work for them. Governments can ignite bold, innovative thinking by bringing startup founders into the ranks of government to help shift the mindset¬†and foster a culture of relentless focus on customer needs and experience. The lean startup model could work for introducing high-tech government services as well as it did for Uber or AirB\u0026amp;B. This may require a mindset shift at all levels of government, but I believe that citizens will see iteration and a commitment to continuous improvement as a real positive and ultimately rally around forward-thinking local governments that apply startup best practices to rolling out new or improves services to citizens online.\nDigital First Governments - Links, Resources \u0026amp; References This post was inspired in part by RBC Disruptors.
